# Doubly Robust Difference-in-Differences
This Python program shows how to incorporate covariates in a 2x2 DiD design with conditional parallel trend assumption. The following three approaches are considered: Outcome regression,  inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust DiD. I use the Example 13.4 from Jeffery Woodridge's Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach.
